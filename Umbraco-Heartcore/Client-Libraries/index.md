# Client Libraries

In order for you to get started with Umbraco Heartcore we have created a set of client libraries for you to use for testing and for getting a seamless start with the product. 

We recommend testing with these libraries if you are looking to explore the potential of the product.

Both the .NET Core and the Node.js client libraries includes samples that you can connect to you Heartcore project and start testing in no time.

## [.NET Core](Dot-Net-Core)

A .NET Core client library for the Umbraco Heartcore APIs. The library is based on Netstandard2.0 to support application development including Xamarin/UWP applications.

This client library includes 2 samples:

* An [ASP.NET Core MVC sample](Dot-Net-Core/MVC-Sample) site, with custom routing and controller hijacking.
* A [console application](Dot-Net-Core/#console-sample), with options using the Content Delivery and the Content Management API.

## [Node.js](Node-JS)

A Node.js client library for the Umbraco Heartcore REST APIs. This client library includes a Koa sample that you can hook up to your Umbraco Heartcore project for testing.
