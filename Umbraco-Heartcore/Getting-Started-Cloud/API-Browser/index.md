# API Browser

Sometimes it would be useful to see how the APIs that power Heartcore work. 

With the built-in API browser, you are able to test your output and the formatting of your content before connecting to your website or application.

Within the Settings section, you can expand the "Headless" tree to see the "API Browser". Using the browser you can see responses for your content in both the [Content Management](../API-Documentation/Content-Management) and [Content Delivery](../API-Documentation/Content-Delivery) APIs.
