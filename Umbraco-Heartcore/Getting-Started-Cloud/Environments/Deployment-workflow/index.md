# Deployment workflow

Having multiple environments on your Umbraco Heartcore project can be a great asset for testing and for having a place where your content editors can work without interferring with anything on the Live environment.

It is a classic "left to right" deployment model, meaning that changes are first made in the Development environment and then deployed to the Staging or Live environment - depending on the plan your project is on.
