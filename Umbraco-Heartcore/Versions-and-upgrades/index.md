# Versions and upgrades

Umbraco Heartcore is a headless SaaS (software as a service) product, which means that one of the benefits is that you do not have to worry about upgrades. These will all be handled by Umbraco HQ.

In this article you can learn more about how we handle upgrades for both the Umbraco Backoffice and the Umbraco Heartcore Rest API.

## Umbraco versions

The Umbraco backoffice, which on a Heartcore project serves as the UI for content creation, will automatically be upgraded to a newer version whenever new and relevant features are released for the Umbraco CMS.

Upgrades like these will have no effect on your content or your live application.
