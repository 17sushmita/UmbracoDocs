# Maintaining packages

Creating and publishing your package is one thing. But what do you need to do, and what do you need to think about, after it's been released?

## Keep it up-to-date

When a new version of Umbraco is released you should test your package on the latest version to confirm it all still works. 

If it does then it would be helpful to report this on the 'Package Compatibility' section of the package's public page on [Our](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/).

TODO: if it doesn't work!

## Manage feature requests and issues

TODO: talk about forums, managing requests / issues / labels

### Find collaborators

If you are a sole maintainer of a package then it's a really good idea to find someone to help you. If you have accepted pull requests from people then why not ask them if they would like to collaborate.

If someone requests a feature that you think is a good fit but you don't have the time, then ask that person if they would like to work with you to get it added.

If you'd love to find a collaborator but don't know where to start, please get in touch with the Packages Team as they should be able to help.
