# Packages

## What is a Package?
A package extends Umbraco to provide additional functionality to editors, developers, site visitors, and all other types of users of Umbraco. It can impact one or more of these groups of people depending on the type of package.

An Umbraco Package can be many things, but are generally characterized by:

- Adding or extending functionality in the Umbraco CMS
- Empowering people to do more and/or do things more efficiently
- Engaging community members in collaboration and sharing
- Solving real life problems
- Inspiring people on what Umbraco can be made capable of

### Categories of packages

Packages provide a wide variety of functionality, and can often span multiple categories. In general, though, the functionality they provide fall into these main groups:

 - [Schema Extensions](#schema-extensions): e.g. Data Types, Doc Types,
 - Management Extensions: e.g. Dashboards, Admin tools
 - Starter Kits
 - Content Apps
 - Integration Extensions: e.g. E-Commerce packages

 There is also another way of categorising packages which is based around their use-case:
 
 - **Editor Enhancements**: Property Editors, Content Apps, etc. that extends Umbraco with new ways of editing content
 - **Administration tools**: Dashboards, Health Checks, etc. that helps administrators with a better overview of content
 - **Starter Kits**: Complete websites or large features that enables both editors and developers to get a head start
 - **Backoffice developer functionality** Productivity tools for developers that increases developer productivity and skills 

#### Schema Extensions

A package that can be categorised as a Schema Extension will extend the default Umbraco Schema. Schema in this sense is things like Data Types / Property Editors / Document Types / Media Types. By extending Umbraco with packages such as [Our.Umbraco.GMaps](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/ourumbracogmaps-google-maps-for-umbraco-8/) it gives editors greater capabilities when they are populating their content pages.
