## The Init command

The init command helps you create a package.xml file, which is the file in an Umbraco package that contains all the metadata for a package - things like author info, version compatibility, etc.
The init command can be used by typing:

```
UmbPack init
```

It is usually used to scaffold a package.xml file that you can then use with the `pack` command to create an Umbraco package.
