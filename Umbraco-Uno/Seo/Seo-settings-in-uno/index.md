# SEO settings in Uno

In the SEO Settings, you will be setting up your company information for SEO, which increases your visibility in search results when someone searches for something related to your company.

In order to receive the best possible SEO score for your Umbraco Uno website, we recommend that you carefully fill out each of the fields on the SEO settings page.

Below here, is a guide on how to setup the SEO.

In the [Uno-Pedia](../../Uno-pedia) you can find more details on each of the fields; how to fill them in and where they are added.

Here's a quick guide on how to setup the SEO settings page:

1. In the **Content** section, expand the home node (in this case that would be ***Unicorn Hotel***)
2. Expand **Settings** and select **SEO**
