# Adding a form to a widget

There are multiple ways of adding a form to your content pages in Umbraco Uno. In this guide, you will learn of two ways to add forms to a site through the use of widgets.

The first option is to add the widget called Umbraco forms. In this widget, you will get the option to select which form you want to add. You can read about this widget's settings in the article about the [Umbraco Forms widget](../../Widgets/Umbraco-Form).

The second option is to add the form through the grid widget. This is not the same set up as in the regular widget. However, the way you add the form is the same as the first option go to the section of the widget that says ***Form*** and then press add and select the form you want.
