# Adding a form to a widget

If you need to add forms to your website, there are multiple ways of doing this in Umbraco Uno.

The first option is to add the widget called Umbraco forms. In this widget, you will get the option to select which form you want to add. You can read about this widget's settings in the [Umbraco Forms](../../Widgets/Umbraco-Form).

The second option is to add the form through the grid widget. This is not the same set up as in the regular widget. However, the way you add the form is the same as the first option go to the section of the widget that says ***Form*** and then press add and select the form you want.
