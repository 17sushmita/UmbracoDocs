# How to Check your form replies

Suppose you have a form on your frontend, and you want to check if you go some repies to your form. However, you do not know how to see your replies. Then this article is for you.
What you want to do is, go to the forms section in the back office, then in the big window located in the middle of the screen. Depending on how many forms you have, this can look differently. If you only have one form, there will be a box showing you how many replies you have. Clicking this box will bring you to an overview of all the replies, and you can click into each of them to see them filled out.

If you have more then one form, there will be a box for each of the forms. If you have more then four forms, you will have the option to ***show all*** as only four will be shown as default.

You can also click the forms in the tree to see the entries for each of the forms.
