# Setting up a form

In this guide you will learn how to set up a form in the backoffice, when you get an uno project it comes with the unicorn hotel template, and that includes two forms However, suppose those forms dont meet your needs then you can create your own.

* First you will have to navigate to the forms section in the back office.
* Then when in the forms section, in the tree on the left there's an folder icon next to that it says ***Forms*** hover this and click the ***...*** button that shows up.
* A list will show up, on that list select Empty form.

Now we have taken the first step to create our very own form. In the next steps we will name the form and add the fields that it needs to contain.

* Enter the forms name where it says ***Enter Name***.
* You will see that the form already contains an item this is the permision to store data so if you need this for the for you are creting you can go ahead an leave that, otherwise tou can delete it by clicking the bin icon in the top of the field.
* Now to adding a group Click where it says ***Add new group***.
* Follow up by clicking ***Add Question***.
* Name the first question "Name" and chose a ***short answer*** for the answer type.
* In the settings further down put it to mandatory and add the text that will show if this mandatory field is not filled in.
* when that is done hit the green submit button in the buttom.

Now that we hav done this you will now have a form containing two items(if you chose to keep the data permission field). However you might what to rearrange them this can be done by hitting the ***Reorder*** button and dragging the grups in the order you want.

:::tip
It can be a good idea to name the grups to keep track of what each group does, this can be done by clicking where it says ***Untitled group***.

Now you can go ahead and add what you like to the form and when you are done hit save, once that is done you will have a new custom made form to add to your widgets.
In the next artice you can learn to [add a form to a widget](../Adding-a-form-to-a-widget).
