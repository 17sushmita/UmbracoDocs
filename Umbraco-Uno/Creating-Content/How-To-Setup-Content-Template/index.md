Umbraco Uno offers the option to make a template of your page, to get a nice work procress, so that you won't have to set the same page up multiple times.

## What is a Content Template

A Content Template, lets you create a page containing a set up of widgets.

## How to set it up

Setting up your template comes in two parts, first you need to make a page that has the widgets you want, and then turn that into a template.
