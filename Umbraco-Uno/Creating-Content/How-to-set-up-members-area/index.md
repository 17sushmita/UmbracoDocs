### Members area

Before we create the login widget, it is a good idea to make the member's area. This is because when we are setting up the login widget, we will have to link to the page that it takes the user to after the login.

To set-up a members area:

1. Press "..." next to Unicorn Hotel/home node and choose to create a page
2. Set up the new page how you would like your member's area to look


### Login

Finally, we will end this guide by adding the login page.

To add the login page:

1. Select the page you want to have your login page on
2. Add the login widget and fill out every field how you like
3. In the field that says redirect URL choose the members page that you made in the previous chapter.

Now you should have a system that lets users register and login to a secluded members area.
