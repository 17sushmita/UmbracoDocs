# Newsletter

The Newsletter Widget, lets you create a sign-up form for your newsletter. This will require some setting up.
The way this widget works is that you set it up with your Mailchimp or Campaign monitor, then you add your API key and set the ID for the list that the user will be subscribed to.
You can setup all this in the [General Settings](../../Settings/General-Settings/index.md#newsletter) page.

The newsletter widget allows people who visit your page to type in their email in the sign-up box after which they will receive a newsletter whenever you send one.
