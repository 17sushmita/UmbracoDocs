# Updates on Uno

On an Umbraco Uno project, you won't see your version number. This is because all uno projects will be kept up to dates by our developers. What does this mean for you? Well, it means that you won't have to worry about updating your Uno project to keep it up to date. We do that for you. However, suppose you are using custom code. This is not how it works. If you are using custom code, you will have to update your minor versions manually. When you enable custom code, you make your Uno project function like an ordinary cloud project, making it follow the upgrade rules of ordinary cloud projects.
