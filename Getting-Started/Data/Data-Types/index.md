#Data-Types
*A Data Type defines the type of input for a property. There are a number of of preconfigured Data Types available in Umbraco and more can be added in the Developer section.*

##What is a data type?
A Data Type can be something very simple (textstring, number, true/false,...) or more complex (multi node tree picker, image cropper, Grid Layout)

The Data type references a Property Editor and are configured in the Umbraco backoffice in the developer section. You can (and probably should) have multiple Data Types that reference the same Property Editor.

##Creating a new Data-Type
*Data types are created in the Developer Section of the backoffice*

//TODO: Fill this in
