#Data
*This section focuses on how to create data using the Umbraco backoffice.*

There are three kinds of content in Umbraco. Your normal website content that exists in the content section. Media content such as images, videos and PDFs can be stored in the Media section. Finally members, used for user profiles and frontend authentication are in the Members section.

A fundamental principle in Umbraco is that all content types have a definition. These definitions are highly customisable, meaning you can add properties and have complete control over how the data is organized.

##[Defining Content](Defining-content/index.md)
Defining Documents Types, adding properties and creating your first content.

##[Creating Media](Creating-Media/index.md)
Defining Media Types and uploading files to the media section, using upload fields and image cropper.

##[Working with Members](Members/index.md)
Defining Member Types and creating members for authentication and user profiles

##[Customizing Data Types](Data-Types)
Creating and editing Data Types.
