#Using Umbraco's service APIs

_Whenever you need to modify an entity that Umbraco stores in the database - there is a service API available for it. this means that
you can create, update and delete any of the core Umbraco entities directly from your custom code._


##Accessing the Umbraco services.
To use the service APIs - you must first access them. This is done through what is know as `ApplicationContext` which provides access to everything related
to the Umbraco application.


###Access via Controller
If accessing umbraco services inside your own controller class - then by inheriting from one of Umbraco's base controller classes you get access to all services through Â´Services`:

```
public class EventController : Umbraco.Web.Mvc.SurfaceController
{
    public Action PerformAction()
    {
       var content = Services.ContentService.GetById(1234);
    }
}
```

###Access via ApplicationEventHandler
If we for instance subscribe to the ApplicationStarted event - we get access to this context - which then provides a `.Services` class which contains all the
available services

```
public class EventHandler : Umbraco.Core.ApplicationEventHandler
{
    protected override void ApplicationStarted(UmbracoApplicationBase umbracoApplication, ApplicationContext applicationContext)
    {
        var c = applicationContext.Services.ContentService.GetById(1234);
        applicationContext.Services.ContentService.Delete(c);
    }
}
```
