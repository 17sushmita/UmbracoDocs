## Getting Started with Headless

The easiest way to get started with an Umbraco Headless project is to sign up for a new project using the Headless sign up link.

We set up the entire project for you, so everything is ready for you to start developing your headless website or application.

We highly recommend looking into the available clients and using those to access the Headless API for your new project.

You can however also choose to work directly with the API if you feel that the clients are not a good fit for your project.
