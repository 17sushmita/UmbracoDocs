# Migrate Umbraco 7 Cloud project to Umbraco 8

This article will provide detailed steps on how to migrate an Umbraco 7 Cloud project to Umbraco 8.

## Prerequisites

* An Umbraco 7 Cloud project running **at least Umbraco 7.14.**
* A clean Umbraco 8.1+ Cloud project with **at least 2 environments**

:::note
We strongly recommend having at least 2 environments on the Umbraco 8.1+ Cloud project.

Should something fail during the migration, the Development environment can always be removed and re-added in order to start over on a clean slate.
