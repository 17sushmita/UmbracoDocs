# Set Up
Now that you've created a project there are a few things you may want to do to make working with your project easier. As you get ready to launch your live site there are some other considerations to take into account as well.

Most of the set up can be accomplished by using the options from your project's Settings drop down. Some of the setup applies to all of your projects, so you'll make these updates from your profile section.

## Naming a Project
When you create an Umbraco Cloud project you will get to choose your own name for the project. You will also be able to choose which color the project should have in your project overview. If you are creating a Trial project for the first time, a unique project name will be generated for you, based on the name you put in the signup-form - and a color will be chosen for you at random. 

You can at anytime change the name of your project by using the _Rename project_ option from the _Settings_ dropdown. **NOTE**: If you are working locally you need to make a fresh local clone of the project, once youâ€™ve changed your project name.

An Umbraco Cloud project name is unique which means if a project with the name you choose already exists, you will need to choose another name before you can create the project.
