#Set Up
Now that you've created a project there are a few things you may want to do to make working with your project easier. As you get ready to launch your live site there are some other considerations to take into account as well.

Most of the set up can be accomplished by using the options from your project's Settings drop down. Some of the setup applies to all of your projects, so you'll make these updates from your profile section.

##Naming a Project
When you create an Umbraco Cloud project you will get to choose your own name for the project. You will also be able to choose which color the project should have in your project overview. If you are creating a Trial project for the first time, a unique project name will be generated for you, based on the name you put in the signup-form - and a color will be chosen for you at random. 

You can at anytime change the name of your project by using the _Rename project_ option from the _Settings_ dropdown. **NOTE**: If you are working locally you need to make a fresh local clone of the project, once youâ€™ve changed your project name.

An Umbraco Cloud project name is unique which means if a project with the name you choose already exists, you will need to choose another name before you can create the project.

##Deleting a Project
This does what it says. Once you've confirmed deletion of a project it is permanently removed as are all data, media, databases, configuration, setup, and domain bindings. So, make sure this is what you want.

##Domains (Hostname binding)
You can bind any hostname to your project environments. Keeping in mind, of course, that the hostname will need to have a DNS entry so that it resolves to the Umbraco Cloud service.

You can bind a total of 15 hostnames to each of your Umbraco Cloud environments. 

Once you add a domain to one of your environments make sure to update the hostname DNS entry to resolve to the umbraco.io service. We recommend setting an ALIAS record for your root domain (e.g. mysite.s1.umbraco.io), rather than an A record for the umbraco.io service IP address. Check with your DNS host or domain registrar for details on how to configure this for your domain.



##IP Whitelist
You can add specific IP addresses to the whitelist to automatically allow any client from these addresses to access the frontend of your _Development_ or _Staging_ environments without the initial authorization dialog. This can also reduce the amount of times you or your team will need to enter your credentials in order to access your projects.

As with all things security related, make sure you use this feature judiciously as it will allow access to your Umbraco backoffice login page without requiring the initial authentication. Of course, the Umbraco backoffice will still require authentication.

###Timezones
From your profile settings you can set your timezone. This applies to the display of status messages in the Umbraco Cloud portal and makes it easier to determine the actual time a particular status was created.

###Experimental Features
You can enable the availability of experimental features for your projects. This includes features that may not be functionally complete and are not supported by Umbraco HQ. We recommend enabling this only if you fully understand the feature you will be using or are strictly using the project as a test.
