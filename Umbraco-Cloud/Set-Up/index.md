# Set Up
Now that you've created a project there are a few things you may want to do to make working with your project easier. As you get ready to launch your live site there are some other considerations to take into account as well.

Most of the set up can be accomplished by using the options from your project's Settings drop down. Some of the setup applies to all of your projects, so you'll make these updates from your profile section.
