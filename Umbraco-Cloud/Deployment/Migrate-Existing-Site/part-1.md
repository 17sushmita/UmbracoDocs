# Prepare your site for migration

You've now made sure that your project meets all the requirements for being migrated to Umbraco Cloud, and we are ready to get started!

First order of business is to upgrade your project to the latest Umbraco version. Why? Because Umbraco Cloud always runs the latest version and you need to make sure your project runs the same Umbraco version as Umbraco Cloud.
You can download the latest version of Umbraco here.
