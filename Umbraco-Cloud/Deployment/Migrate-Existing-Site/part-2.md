# Merge with your Umbraco Cloud project

In this part you are going to setup your Umbraco Cloud project, clone it down to your local machine and start merging the files from your own project into the new Cloud project.

## Setup your Umbraco Cloud project
Before the migration process can start, you will need to have an Umbraco Cloud project you can migrate your own project into.

1. The best way to get started with Umbraco Cloud is to start a trial. You can do this, by visiting [umbraco.com](http://umbraco.com).
2. When your project is starting choose to start with a *clean slate* - you need to have an empty Cloud project for the migration to be succesful.
3. We recommend that you setup your project with at least two environments.
