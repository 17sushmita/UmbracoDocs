# Deploy to the Cloud

You are almost there! Just a few more steps, and you will be able to see how your migrated project looks on Umbraco Cloud. All project files have been merged and you've generated UDA files for all your metadata. In this chapter, you are going to deploy your entire project to your Umbraco Cloud Development environment.

## Deploying the metadata
1. In your Git client you should see a lot of changes ready to be committed
2. Stage and commit the changes
3. Do a *pull* just to be sure everything is in sync
4. Push your migrated project to the Umbraco Cloud environment
    * If you have a very large commit to push, you may need to configure your Git client for this.
    * Use: git config http.postBuffer 524288000
