# The Umbraco Cloud Portal

To make working with your Umbraco Cloud projects as simple as possible we've build the Umbraco Cloud Portal, where you can view and manage all your projects. 

One for managing all your Umbraco Cloud projects and one for managing your individual projects.

## Manage your projects

When you login to the Umbraco Cloud Portal you will be presented with a view of all the Umbraco Cloud projects you've created or has been added to as a team member.

You can easily browse through the projects by using the search field. For quick access you can *favorite* the projects you are currently working, to make them appear as the first projects in the view.

By default the projects are ordered by latest updates - projects you've worked on recently will be showed on top and the ones you've haven't worked with in a while are in the bottom.

In the top-right corner of the projects view you'll find an option to create more projects. Simply choose the plan you want and a project will be ready for you within a few minutes.
