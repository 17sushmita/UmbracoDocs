# Organizations 
On Umbraco Cloud it is possible to be part of an organization. And organization is a way for you to associate users to one organization.
The benefits are currently limited, but we are working on improving the features available for organizations.
Currently organizations are created by Umbraco HQ - so **reach out to support** to hear more about the feature, and weather they apply for your scenario.

## Invite organization to collaborate
Once you have an organization you will be able to invite other organizations to collaborate for you.
By inviting an organization the following is will happen
* You allow a superadmin in that organization to create projects on behalf of your organization
* You will be able to choose from super admins in the invited organization, when adding members to a project.
  * This effectly enalbes the super admin in that organization access to your project, but also allows her to invite other member from that organization.
