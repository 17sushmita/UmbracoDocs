## An Umbraco Cloud project



Umbraco Cloud projects are made of three major components: environments, team members and a settings section.

The number of environments on your project is dependent on which plan you are on:

* With the **Starter plan** you get a single _Live_ environment and have the option to add additional environments - a _Development_ and a _Staging_ environment
* With the **Professional plan** you will get a _Development_ AND a _Live_ environment - as with the Starter Plan you can add/remove environments as needed

The second major component on your Umbraco Cloud project are the team members. When you add team members to a project, they will automatically be added as backoffice users on all the environments as well. Team members can be added as *Admins*, *Writers* or *Readers*. Read the [Team Members article](../../Set-up/Team-members) to learn more about these roles.

The final major component on your Umbraco Cloud project is the *Settings*, where you can manage and configure your project to fit your needs. Learn more about the different settings in the [Umbraco Cloud Portal]() article.
