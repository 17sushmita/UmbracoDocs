# ModelsBuilder

ModelsBuilder allows you to easily use strongly typed models in your views, based on the document types you have created in the backoffice.

Documentation for using the advanced features of ModelsBuilder will be migrated to the official Umbraco documentation, but until then you can find the documentation at the [ModelsBuilder github repository](https://github.com/zpqrtbnk/Zbu.ModelsBuilder/wiki)
