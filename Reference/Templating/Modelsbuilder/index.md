# Umbraco Models Builder

The Models builder is a tool that can generate a complete set of strongly-typed published content models for Umbraco. Models are available in both controllers and views.

:::note
Since version 8.4, Umbraco has shipped with an embedded slimmed down version of the ModelsBuilder. The embedded version can be replaced with the full version by adding the full version using NuGet.
