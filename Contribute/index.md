# Contribute to the Umbraco Documentation

The Umbraco Documentation is presented here on Our Umbraco, but is in fact also a GitHub repository and it is just as open source as the Umbraco CMS.

You can contribute to the documentation whenever you feel something is missing or out of date, and all you need to do it, is an account on GitHub.

In this section you can learn much more about the various ways of contributing.

## How to get started

There are more than one way that you can contribute to the Umbraco Documentation. Which approach to take, depends on what you want to achieve with your contribution.

* Request a quick / minor change to an article by submitting a [Pull Request](Pull-Requests/#option-1-creating-a-pr-directly-on-github)
* Submit a more extensive update / change by [forking the Documentation repository](Pull-Requests/#options-2-creating-a-pr-through-a-fork)
* Raise a question, start a discussion or report an issue on the [Issue Tracker](Issues/)

## Annotating a document

To add version information and extra keywords, [every document can be annotated using YAML](adding-metadata.md).

## Multi version documentation

With the introduction of every new version of Umbraco, new features are introduced.  This means that not every document will work for your possibly older version.

Therefore we introduced 2 different mechanisms:

1. The [YAML meta data describing](adding-metadata.md) `versionFrom` and `versionTo`.
2. The possibility [to add multiple files about the same topic](file-naming-conventions.md)

## Documentation Curators

All the work of adding labels, going through issues and PR's and managing the Documentation repository is done by the Umbraco Documentation Curators team. If you wish to know more about who they are and how they work there is some information about them here: https://our.umbraco.com/community/the-documentation-curators/

## Contribution badge

If you make a pull request to any Umbraco repository that gets merged in you will get a Contributor badge on your member profile on [Our](https://our.umbraco.com):

The Documentation Curators will search for your profile when merging a PR in and add the badge. 
If it is forgotten just make a comment on the closed PR and we will do it as soon as possible!
