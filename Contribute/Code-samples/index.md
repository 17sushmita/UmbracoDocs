# Code samples

The articles in the Umbraco Documentation can in most cases benefit from relevant code samples to support the written text.

In this article you will find some tips and tricks for adding code samples to articles as well as some best practices which outline how we recommend formatting and using code samples.

## When to use code samples

Code samples are relevant for most types of articles in the Umbraco Documentation. Potentially, any topic covered could benefit from a real-life code sample to support the surrounding contents of the article.

You might want to base an entire article on one code sample, or perhaps you're describing a flow or feature where you might want to add several smaller code snippets to highlight various points.

### Types of samples

As a basis, we're working with 3 types of code samples in the Umbraco Documentation.

#### Inline code

Use inline code when you are referrencing methods or names.

Example:

```markdown
I am using inline code, to reference a `name` of a method.
```

#### Smaller code snippets

#### Large code samples

## Best practices

* Add a clear description
* Use code-comments
* Use real-life samples
* Add only compilable samples
* Check for syntax errors
