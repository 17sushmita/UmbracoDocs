# What is an Issue?




Creating an issue

The Umbraco Documentation uses [GitHub issues](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs/issues) to manage issues with the documentation.
You can make an issue for any of the following:

- If you feel some documentation is wrong or missing and you do not have time or knowledge to do a PR.
- If the issue will need more than one PR.
- Open a discussion about possible improvements or ways to deal with something in the documentation.

You can also find a button in the top right corner of every page in the documentation itself that looks like this:
![Our issue button](images/report-issue.png)  

We compiled a [list of labels](github-issues.md) which we use regularly to tag issues.
