# Adding Language Variants 

Now that we have a basic site set up, let's explore one of the cool new features brought on in Umbraco v8; Language Variants. For this we will make a Danish version of the `Contact Us` page. At this point your page should look like this:

## Adding a new language

So the first thing we should do is go to the **_Settings > Language_** and then click the `Add Language` button at the top. In the dropdown you can select a long list of languages, in this tutorial we will pick Danish.

As you can see there are several options, to add a fallback language, make it mandatory and so on, we will just leave it default for now but if you want to ensure all content has a language varied version then make them mandatory.

## Enabling Language Variants on Document Types and Properties

Now head on over to **_Document Types > Simple Content Page > Permissions_** and check the `Allow varying by culture` checkbox, now click save and go to the **_Design_** tab. 

We will now edit the settings of our property editors, so click on the little gear icon âš™ for the **_Page Title_** editor and again check the `Allow varying by culture` checkbox.

For now we will leave the **_Body Text_** property editor unchanged, so click save in the bottom right corner and head on over to **_Content > Contact Us_**. Now there will be a language dropdown next to the title at the top:

When you click the dropdown you will get a list of all the languages you have enabled. When you mouseover a language an `Open in Splitview` box will appear, click this to open it.

In this splitview we will be able to see the content node with each language side by side. You may notice that the bodytext is greyed out - this is because we haven't checked the `Allow varying by culture` checkbox for that property editor.

You can now click publish at the bottom of the page and it will give you the option to publish one or more languages.

Now if you head on over to your contact us page you will see it looks the same, but if you then access /kotakt-os or whatever you have called the new Language Varied node, then you will see the headline change to what you put in!
