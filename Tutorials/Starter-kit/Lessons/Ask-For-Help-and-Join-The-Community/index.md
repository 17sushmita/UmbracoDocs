# Ask For Help and Join the Community
If you need help, where do you find it?

## Outcome
You're a registered user on **Our**, the community portal for Umbraco.  Maybe you've even signed up to attend a nearby meetup!

## Steps
1. Visit [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.org/member/Signup) and register to become part of The Friendly CMS.
2. Search the forum for answers to your question.
3. Create a forum post if you still don't know the best way to proceed. There are active community members on 24/7 so you shouldn't have long to wait for a reply.  We are always super excited to hear from newcomers!
4. Look for meetups in your area. And if there aren't any, look for any online community hangouts happening soon, and sign up to one of those.
