## Steps
1. Visit [Our Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.org/member/Signup) and register to become part of The Friendly CMS.
2. Search the forum for answers to your questions.  There's also a [heap of documentation](https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/) if you prefer the RTFM approach.
3. Please create a forum post if you don't know the best way to proceed. There are active community members with years of experience on 24/7 so you shouldn't have long to wait for a reply.  We are always super excited to hear from newcomers!
4. Check the home page of Our for any upcoming meetups near you. And if there aren't any, keep an eye out for any online community hangouts happening soon.
5. Finally do think about [contributing yourself](https://our.umbraco.org/contribute/). Even if it's just pointing out something in the documentation that could be made clearer, we'd love to hear from you.
