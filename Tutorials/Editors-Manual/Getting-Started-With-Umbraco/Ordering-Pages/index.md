#Ordering Pages
This is intended as an instructional guide for how you can sort your items in the tree section.

The pages in Umbraco are sorted in the tree structure according to a predefined sort order. It is most common for the page that has been created most recently to be placed at the bottom of the tree structure, however, you can change the sort order of the pages in a section of the website by using the sort function.


In the following guide, you will be presented with two different ways to sort your content in the nodes.

# Ordering through the section tree:
1. Navigate to the ***parent node*** whose content you want to sort.

3. Press the option that says ***sort***.

Clicking on a column header again reverses the sort order.
