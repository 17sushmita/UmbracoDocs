# API Documentation

This page contains documentation for the Umbraco Headless API endpoints divided into two main areas: Content Delivery and Content Mangement

The Content Delivery API is the read-only Content and Media that you would normally retrieve to show the published content in your apps, websites or other media. The API is available on `https://cdn.umbraco.io`

Content Management is where you can Create, Read, Update and Delete Content, Media, Languages, Relations, Members and the associated types using Umbraco Backoffice user credentials or API Keys. The API is available on `https://api.umbraco.io`

## REST API Standard

The Umbraco Headless APIs are based on the HAL Standard, which are explained in greater detail [here](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html).

The properties `_links` and `_embedded` are both part of the HAL specification and are implemented in the Umbraco Headless API according to the specification linked above.

The rest of the properties in the Umbraco Headless API, which starts with an underscore are "system level properties" meaning that they are standard Umbraco properties, which cannot be changed via the API. So properties like `_id`, `_url`, `_createDate`, `_updateDate`, `_creatorName`, `_writerName`, `_level` and `_hasChildren`. These are all defined by Umbraco when Content is created or updated.

### API Browser

From within the Umbraco Backoffice go to the Settings section and the Headless tree, here you can use the API Browser to interact with both the Content Delivery and Content Management APIs. It is recommended to use this browser to explore the json output for all the different endpoints documented under the Content Delivery and Content Management API sections below.

## APIs

There are two main APIs, one for Content Delivery `https://cdn.umbraco.io` and one for Content Management `https://api.umbraco.io`. Both of these APIs share common points of configuration for access, versioning, culture and authentication/authorization, which are highlighted below.

### API Access

In order to access the data for your Umbraco Headless project you need to provide a project identifier (Project Alias) via a HTTP Header or a Querystring parameter.
The Project Alias is an http friendly version of the Project Name under your Umbraco Cloud account.

#### Via a Umb-Project-Alias header

```http
GET https://cdn.umbraco.io/content
Umb-Project-Alias: project-alias
```

#### Via a Query String parameter

```http
GET https://cdn.umbraco.io/content?Umb-Project-Alias=project-alias
```

### Versioning

API versioning is handled by [ASP.NET API Versioning](https://github.com/microsoft/aspnet-api-versioning)

All API requests should specify the API version they target. If no version is specified, the latest version of the API is used, this will break clients when a new version of the API is released.

#### Via an api-version header

```http
GET https://cdn.umbraco.io/content
api-version: 2
```

#### Via a Query String parameter

```http
GET https://cdn.umbraco.io/content?api-version=2
```

#### Via Content negotiation

```http
GET https://cdn.umbraco.io/content
Accept: application/json+hal;v=2
```

## Authentication and Authorization

By default the Content Delivery API is not protected, it can be enabled through the backoffice. The Content Management API is always protected and requires either an API key or a bearer token.

Since both API keys and bearer tokens are created for a specific user their permissions can be set on that user in the backoffice.

### API Keys

API keys can be managed for a user through the backoffice.

#### Via the Authorization header

When using the `Authorization` header the api key must be passed in as the username and the password must be left empty. The value must be base64 encoded e.g. `base64(api-key:)`

```http
GET https://api.umbraco.io/
Authorization: Basic $base64-encoded-string
```

#### Via an Api-Key header

```http
GET https://api.umbraco.io/
Api-Key: api-key
```

### Bearer token

The endpoints implements OAuth 2.0

A bearer token can be created by posting to `https://api.umbraco.io/oauth/token` and supplying a username and password for a backoffice user.

```http
POST https://api.umbraco.io/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=password&username=$username&password=$password
```

and it can be used by passing it to the `Authorization` header.

```http
GET https://api.umbraco.io/
Authorization: Bearer $token
```

## Content Delivery API

This is the read-only API for delivering published content and media to any app, website, device or whatever you prefer.
Itâ€™s worth noting that the json output for both Content and Media vary depending on how a given Content or Media is structured - meaning how the ContentType and MediaType is defined.

### Cultures

Specific to Content in the Content Delivery API.
To request content in a specific language, a culture parameter can be specified.
If no culture is specified its treated as invariant and the default lanuage will be returned.

#### Via an Accept-Language header

```http
GET https://cdn.umbraco.io/content
Accept-Language: en-US
```

#### Via a Query String parameter

```http
GET https://cdn.umbraco.io/content?culture=en-US
```
