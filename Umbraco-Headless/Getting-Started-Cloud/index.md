# Getting Started with Headless (Cloud)

// How to setup a Headless project [BLOCKED]

// It's Cloud, but it's not Cloud 

// The Umbraco Cloud Portal - how can I use that?

// Deployment workflow? Having multiple environments on Headless? 

// Backoffice - API browser (management and delivery) / Webhooks 
- link to general info about content creations .. 

// Upgrades / Umbraco versions / API versions

// CDN [BLOCKED] - we don't know enough
- If not included, what then?
- How to use it, when it's included?

Idea for folder structure:
## Cloud, but not Cloud
## Cloud Portal / Deployments
## Backoffice / features
## Upgrades
## CDNs (does that need to be an article on it's own)
