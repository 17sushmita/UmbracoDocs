## [Getting Started with the .NET Core Client Library](Getting-Started-DotNetCore/)

The .NET Core Client Library is an easy and convenient way of working with the Umbraco Headless APIs when you are building apps, websites, xamarin apps or other .NET based code. This library is based on NET Standard 2.0 meaning that it can be used for almost anything .NET based.

The .NET Core Client Library covers both the Content Delivery and Content Management APIs. Specifically for the Content Delivery API you can choose to build strongly typed models for your content and media, so it becomes even more intuitive to work with.

The library is available via nuget so you can install it from within Visual Studio.

You can find more details about using the library in this article: ["Getting Started with the .NET Core Client Library"](Getting-Started-DotNetCore/)
