# Getting Started with the .NET Core Client Library

// We need some kind of "middle page" for the libraries (as there are going to be more than one, right?)

// What is a Client library?
// Default info on how to use the Client libraries?
// How to connect?
// Link to the various client libraries

// How can we mention something about this not being supported by HQ?

EXAMPLE: (new folder structure .. )
# Umbraco Headless Client Libraries
## NET Core Client
## VUE JS Client
## NodeJS Client
