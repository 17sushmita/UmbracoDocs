The Map Widget is a feature that lets you use Google Maps to show the location of your choice, this could be if you need to show where your company is located.

The way it works is that you type in the ***Latitude*** and ***Longitude*** and select how zoomed in you want the map to be on a scale from 0 - 20 with 7 being default.

You will have some settings to set the Map widget up as you want it:

- Height
- Custom Map Pin Icon
- Show Content Next To Map
- Pre Heading
- Heading
- Text
- Address
- Phone Number
- Email
- Opening Hours
- Background Color
- Text Color
- Buttons

Below you can see an example of a Map widget with the ***Show Content Next To Map*** Enabled:

When ***Show Content Next To Map*** is disabled the blue section on the left will not appear and the map will take up all the space.
