This widget lets you create an element on your page, where people can register for an account on your website.
They will register by filling out the fields, which are Name, Email, and Password, and finalizing by pressing the Register button. After doing that they will get a message saying that their sign up was successful.

In the backoffice you will be able to see your registerd members by clicking onto the Members tab. Here you can edit members and view how many members you have.

The setup options for this widget are as follows:
