# Slider

![movePage.jpg](images/The-Slider-Widget.png)

The Slider Widget allows you to pick 1 or more widgets to display in a slideshow.

You will have a set of different configuration option in order to customize the slider to fit your needs:

- Choose how fast the transition between widgets is. Note that 1000 is equal to 1 second.
- Decide whether you want the slider to have arrows on the edges which takes you through the slides.
- Enable dots in the buttom to show what slide you are currently on.
- Make the slider pause when you hover over it.
- Choose to have the slider ***Wrap Around*** to make it loop between the widgets indefinitely.  
- Make the transition between slides more seamless by using ***Fade Animation***.

Below is an example of how a slider could look. It contains an ***Image Widget***, uses ***Show Next/prev arrows*** and ***Show Page Dots***. It has a black ***Background Color*** picked in the ***Image Widget***.

::: Note
For the best experience with the Slider Widget, we recommend adding multiple ***Image Widgets*** containing one image each.
