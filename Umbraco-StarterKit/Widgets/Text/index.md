![movePage.jpg](images/The-Text-Widget1.png)

The Text Widget lets you create a text field on the page containing a Rich text editor and the option for adding sidebar widgets. The sidebar widgets can be the following: a text area, links or a button.

This is useful if you only need a text box outside of the Widgets, most of the other Widgets come with the ***Text Widget*** included

::: Note
The Text Widget is the standard width per default, this cannot be changed.
To compare the width see for example ***Image Widget*** and set this to standard width.
