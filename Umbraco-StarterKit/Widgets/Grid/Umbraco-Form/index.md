# Umbraco Forms

If you want to add a form to your Grid this is the way to go about it. It is important to note that the form will have to be created in the Forms section, which you can find in the menu at the top of the site.

## Sample

The options for Umbraco Forms are as follows:

- Column Width (This is mandatory because it decides how large the column containing the Umbraco Forms is)

- Form (This is where you add the form that you have created in the form section)

- Boxed Column (This switch adds a box around the entire Umbraco Forms columns width)
