# Text

Text adds a text field to your Grid. It contains a rich text editor and is very useful if you need a text area in your Grid.

## Sample

The options for Text is as follows:

- Column Width (This is mandatory because it decides how large the column containing Text is)

- Alias (The name of the text field)

- Text (This is the text field itself)

- Boxed (This switch adds a box around the entire Text columns width)
