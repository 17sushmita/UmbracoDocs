# The Grid

The Grid Widget lets you set up a framework of widgets, you will have the ability to make it look the way u want. You can do so by setting up the general look of the grid, and choose what widgets you want your grid to contain.

### Columns

A Column is the boxes wherein you create your content when working in a grid, most of the grid widgets require you to set a column width, this is because it sets the width for how big the box will be and by that determine how many consecutive Columns can be in a row.
### Rows

A Row is a kind of shelf for the columns in the grid, each row has a total column width of 100%, so say you wanted three columns on your row each of these would have to have a column width of 33%.
