**Completely new to Umbraco?**

If you've never worked with Umbraco before, there's a few resources which we recommend that you start with in order to get to know your way around the *backoffice* and learn the essentials for working with content.

## Portal

The Portal is the landing space for when you enter your project, here you will have the options to manage your project.
This is also where you can overview your environments, make changes to them, invite users and Delete environments.
We will continue to refer to this as the portal throughout the rest of the documentation.



## Backoffice

The Backoffice is where you will be working when editing, It is divided into sections in the top of the page.
In the content section of the backoffice, you will have a content tree on the left side of the screen, This content tree is where your content nodes will be when you start making content.
We will continue to refer to this as the Backoffice throughout the rest of the documentation.

## Frontend

The Frontend is what people see when they visit your website, meaning that this is where all the content you create in the backoffice go.
