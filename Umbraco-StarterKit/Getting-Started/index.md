# Getting Started

Umbraco Uno provides a plug and play solution for Umbraco. Using a wide variety of widgets/building blocks Umbraco Uno can be used to create websites for any purpose, be it a large website for a big coorporation or a single landing page for a one-man business.

In this section you can find all the resources you need in order to get the best possible start for working with Umbraco Uno.

**Completely new to Umbraco?**

If you've never worked with Umbraco before, there's a few resources which we recommend that you start with in order to get to know your way around the *backoffice* and learn the essentials for working with content.

## Portal

The Portal is the landing space for when you enter your project, here you will have the options to manage your project.
This is also where you can get an overview of your environments, make changes to them, and invite users.
We will continue to refer to this as the portal throughout the rest of the documentation.
The portal is a general thing when working with Umbraco on the cloud, it is used on both regular cloud projects and Heartcore as well as Umbraco Uno.

## Umbraco Backoffice

The Umbraco Backoffice is where you will be working when editing and creating content. It is divided into sections in the top of the page.
In the content section of the backoffice, you will have a content tree on the left side of the screen, This content tree is where your content nodes will be when you start making content.
We will continue to refer to this as the Backoffice throughout the rest of the documentation.

## Frontend

The Frontend is what people see when they visit your website, meaning that this is where all the content you create in the backoffice goes.
How the frontend looks is completely up to you, and you choose this by creating the look you want in the backoffice, you cannot do any editing on the frontend.
We will continue to refer to this as the Frontend throughout the rest of the documentation.
