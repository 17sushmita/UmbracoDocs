This article aims to give you a better understanding of each of the sections in the Umbraco Backoffice, as well as enabling you to navigate the various Umbraco-specific lingo that you might encounter.

Each section in the Umbraco Backoffice is described in more detail in this Uno-pedia article: [Umbraco Backoffice](../../Uno-pedia/Umbraco-Backoffice).

## Backoffice options (need a better heading for this)

The Umbraco Backoffice consists of a number of **sections**, each with a specific purpose. All sections are available at all times from the purple **sections menu** in the top, where the section that's currently being visited will be highlighted.

In the right side of the sections menu you will find a search option, a **Help section** and **Profile menu**.

### Help section

The Help section provides a set of resources designed to aid you in various tasks that you might need to perform when working with Umbraco Uno.

Each of the **Tours** will take you through a detailed step-by-step guide on a specific task. The amount of Tours added will be updated frequently, and is a resource we highly recommend that new Umbraco users uses.

In the Help section you will also find links to other resources such a this documentation and video material on [Umbraco.TV](https://umbraco.tv).

### Profile menu

The Profile menu provides the option to logout, as well as a few shortcuts to edit the current user.

Users are managed in the **Users** section. Learn more about users and how to manage them in the [Manage Users](../../Manage-users) section.

## Sections

Each section in the Umbraco Backoffice consist of two main areas: a **Section Tree** and a **Dashboard**/**Workspace** area.

### Section Tree

The Section Tree is a menu of the available items and/or workspaces in that section.

In the Content section it will list all the created content, in the Media section it will list all the uploaded media items and in the Users section all existing users and User Groups will be listed.

Learn more about what you can find in each section in the [Uno-pedia](../../Uno-pedia).

### Dashboards and Workspaces

Each section in the Umbraco Backoffice contains at least one **Dashboard** displaying information relevant to that section.

The "Welcome" dashboard in the Content section will display a lot of resources useful for working with Umbraco Uno. In the Users section a dashboard will provide an overview of users who have access to the project and in the Forms section the dashboard displays an overview of the number of entries for each form.

When editing a piece of content, an image or creating a new Members group the area next to the Section Tree will be used as a **workspace** instead of a dashboard. The workspace will contain all the options needed for the specific task, and in many cases the workspace will consist of multiple tabs, which will be accessible from the top-right side of the workspace.
