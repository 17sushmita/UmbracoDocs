# How to set-up your Footer

It can be challenging to set-up a footer if you never tried it before. This guide will help step-by-step, to get a nice looking and informative footer for your website.
In this guide you will be introduced, to some of the features you can add to your footer, namely Navigation. Opening Hours, Contact, and Social Links.

You can set the theme for your footer by navigating to the "Theme" settings node under "Settings" in the Content section. Here you'll find a "Footer" group, where you can choose between dark or light theme, and you can change the container width.

This is how the footer should look after you have gone through the guide:

Start by doing the following:

1. Go to the Umbraco Backoffice
2. Click your home node
3. In the workspace scroll to the bottom and find the section called footer
4. In the field saying “Footer Columns” click “Add Content” this will give you 7 options of content

## [Navigation](../../Uno-pedia/Content-Types/Site-Start/Custom-Navigation/index.md)

Let’s start by adding Navigation, pick "Navigation" on the list

- Click Navigation in the list
- Set column width to 25% as 100% would be the entire width of the page.
- Choose a heading for your navigation list, let’s call it links for now.
- Next got to the field called “Links” and select “Add” then a window pops out on the right -hand side.
- Navigate to the part of the window that says “ Link to page” if this is a clean install you will have the options of Unicorn Hotel or Global Content, If you have created a page you can select that one, however, if that is not the case lets create a link to Unicorn Hotel, we do that by clicking the text, that will mark the field with a green checkmark, finalize by clicking submit.
- Next, we get the option to select children, which is another layer of links. we won't need this for now.
- The final button here is "Only Render Children" which would make the node only display links to the child pages, instead of the selected one
