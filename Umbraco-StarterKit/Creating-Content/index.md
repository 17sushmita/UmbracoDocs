# Creating content

When you are creating content in Umbraco Uno, you will have many tools at your disposal. This page is designed to help you get started on utilizing these tools.

## Choosing the correct tools

When you want to create content, it is a good idea to think about what tools to use for the job.

An example of this could be choosing between the Image widget and the Gallery widget. The Image widget only allows you to add one image, whereas the Gallery widget will allow you to set up a gallery of images and you can also choose to only select one image with that widget

Which of these two widgets you choose to use for the job depends on what you specifically need for this situation.

There is multiple ways to approach content creation, two of these ways could be the following:

Widget based design and structure

- If you do not have a predefined design you want to follow, comming up with a design and a structure based on the possibilities of widgets is a great way to start.
The grid widget gives you all the tools you would need to create a good looking website, all of these widgets are great to work with.
Making a grid is a good way to secure a nice look with a good structure, and these grids can be saved en global content to keep the same look and feel throughout you website pages.

### Manage Media Library

When creating content, you will most likely need to work with media as well. The [Manage Media Library](Manage-Media-Library/index.md) article offers a good piece of insight into how you can do this best.

### Rich Text Editors

The Rich Text Editor or RTE as people call it is a great way to create content. It is a text editor, that allows you to write longer text pieces with all the formatting options you would need.

To learn more about what features the RTE offers, it would be a good idea to read the [Rich Text Editor](Rich-Text-Editors/index.md) article.

### Working With Content

To have the best experience while creating content it is highly recommendable to have a look at the [Working With Content](Work-With-content/index.md) article.

### Working With Widgets

When you're creating content in Umbraco Uno you will primarily be working with Widgets. These allow for a work process that is very straight forward, and they can be arranged in a grid for more complexity.

There are a lot of widgets to choose from. A good place to start would be the [Working With Widgets](Working-With-Widgets/index.md) article.

For a full overview of the Widgets provided with Umbraco Uno see the [Widgets](../Uno-pedia/Widgets/index.md) section in the Uno-pedia.
