## What can you do with a user

As a user has access to your backoffice, you will need to decide what your users need to be able to do in your backoffice, this can be controlled by adding your users to the correct user groups.

### User groups

Creating user groups can be a great way of keeping track of what users have access to in the backoffice.
The way a user group works is that you create it in the user section set up what these groups should have permission to access and change, and then you add the user to the groups accordingly.

### User restrictions

A user can be restricted to only have access to certain areas, you can change what they have access to in the user section.
This can be achieved by entering the user group section, then hit create user, from there you will be able to create user groups with a setup only allowing a user to what they are allowed to do within the group they are in.
