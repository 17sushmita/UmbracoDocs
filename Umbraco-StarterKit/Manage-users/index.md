# Manage users

In this section, you can find all the information and details you need in order to work with and manage both users and members on your website.

## What is a User

A user is someone who has access to the Umbraco backoffice and is not to be confused with Members. When Umbraco has been installed a user will automatically be generated with the login (email) and password entered during installation. Users can be created, edited, and managed in the User section.
You can manage your users so they canâ€™t publish or edit only read, or you can disable someone from your project if they should not have access anymore.

Please note that for now a user cannot be deleted, they can only be disabled.
You will find that your project has a user named themeowner, it is there to make your project work.

Please see the [User](../Manage-users/Users/index.md) section for more information about users and what you can do with them.

## What is a Member

A member is someone who is strictly limited to the front end and typically these members will be customers, clients, or users of your page's front end.
If you want to lern more about how you can manage your [Members](../Manage-users/Members/index.md) Theres an entire article about it.

## What is a Team Member

Invite member in the portal, is a bit of weird one, as you don't invite a member but a user.
While this can be a bit confusing, you can view a team member as a user of the backoffice.
When you invite a team member you can decide if they need admin access, if you grant them that they will be able to access and edit everything.
