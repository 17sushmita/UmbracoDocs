# Feed

Many websites requires a new section or a blog or sometimes even both. With Umbraco Starterkit that can be achieved used the **Feed** content type. Once a Feed has been setup, **Posts** can be created as child elements or subpages - these could be anything from blogposts to news articles.

Besides being a feed-archive for posts, the Feed content type also has a Content tab with a set of groups similar to the ones found on the Site and the Page content type:

* Content for adding widgets
* [SEO](../../Settings/Specific-Settings/#seo)
* [Settings](../../Settings/Specific-Settings/#settings)

:::note
Any widgets added to the Feed content type, will be shown below the feed of posts.
