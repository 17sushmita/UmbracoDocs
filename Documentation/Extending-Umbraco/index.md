#Extending Umbraco

###[Dashboards](Dashboards/index.md)

A Dashboard is a component for displaying elements on the right-hand side of the backoffice UI area.

###[Sections & Trees](Section-Trees/index.md)

The Umbraco back office consists of sections (sometimes referred to as applications) which contain trees. For example, when you load the back office you'll see that the 'Content' section contains one tree: the content tree whereas the 'Settings' section contains a number of trees: Stylesheets, Content Types, Media Types, etc...

Both sections and trees can be created to extend Umbraco.

###[Property Editors](Property-Editors/index.md)

A property editor is the editor used to insert content into Umbraco. An example of a property editor is the Rich Text Editor. 

Property Editors are sometimes confused with Data Types - its possible to have many rich text editor *Data Types* with different settings and different names which all use the same underlying Rich Text Editor *Property Editor*. 

###[Macro Parameter Editors](Macro-Parameter-Editors/index.md)

A Parameter Editor is the editor used to insert values into a [Macro](../reference/templating/macros/index.md).
