#Extending Umbraco

###[Dashboards](Dashboards/index.md)

A Dashboard is a component for displaying elements on the right-hand side of the backoffice UI area.

###[Macro Parameter Editors](Macro-Parameter-Editors/index.md)

A parameter editor defines the usage of a property editor for use as a parameter for Macros.

###[Packaging](Packaging/index.md)
Information on the packaging manifest format and how assets should be packaged as a zip file for easy distribution
**(coming soon)**

###[Property Editors](Property-Editors/index.md)

A property editor is a way to insert content into Umbraco. An example of a property editor is the Rich Text Editor. It may be confused with Data Types. Its possible to have many Rich Text Editor Data Types with different settings that all use the Rich Text Editor property editor. **(coming soon)**

###[Sections & Trees](Section-Trees/index.md)

The Umbraco back office consists of sections (sometimes referred to as applications) which contain trees. For example, when you load the back office you'll see that the 'Content' section contains one tree: the content tree whereas the 'Settings' section contains a number of trees: Stylesheets, Content Types, Media Types, etc...

Both sections and trees can be created to extend Umbraco.
