#UmbracoHelper

UmbracoHelper is the unified way to work with published content/media on your website. Whether you are using MVC or WebForms you will be able to use UmbracoHelper to query/traverse Umbraco published data. UmbracoHelper is also available from within [Partial View Macros](../Templating/Macros/Partial-View-Macros/index.md) which is why Partial View Macro's are the recommended macro format (which work in both MVC and WebForms).  

**This is the recommended approach to working with Umbraco published content.**

UmbracoHelper also has a variety of helper methods that are useful when working in your views, controllers and webforms classes.

**Are you using [MVC](../../Templating/Mvc/index.md)?** UmbracoHelper will expose the currently executing page model but when using MVC, this model is instantly available in your views via your [view's model](../../Templating/Mvc/views/index.md).
