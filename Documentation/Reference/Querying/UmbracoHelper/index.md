#UmbracoHelper

UmbracoHelper is the unified way to work with published content/media on your website. Whether you are using MVC or WebForms you will be able to use UmbracoHelper to query/traverse Umbraco published data. UmbracoHelper is also available from within [Partial View Macros](../Templating/Macros/Partial-View-Macros/index.md) which is why Partial View Macro's are the recommended macro format (which work in both MVC and WebForms).  

**This is the recommended approach to working with Umbraco published content.**
