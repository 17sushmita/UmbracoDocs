#Conclusions

What we now have is a fully fledged working site! Hopefully this guide should have given you all of the basics to see how to create your own site in Umbraco. For the majority of sites you’ll create they won’t be much more complicated than this. We’ve not written any code nor have we needed to work much out of the Umbraco UI. 

This is not the limit of Umbraco – you’ve barely scratched the surface in this guide.

*    For further reading / exercises I’d recommend working through the video tutorials: http://umbraco.com/help-and-support/video-tutorials.aspx
*    There is also a wiki (of which the intention is to use this guide to populate the “Creating a basic site with Umbraco” section). http://our.umbraco.org/documentation 
*    For help and guidance on anything this guide doesn’t cover the forums are a great place to start:
