# The Licensing Model

Umbraco Forms and Umbraco Courier are commercial products. When you install them from the backoffice of your installation you will have a 14-day free trial to try out the products.

After your trial expires, you'll need to have a **valid license** in order to keep using the products on your site.

## How does it work?

Licenses for our products are sold per domain and will also work on all subdomains. With every license you will also be able to configure two development / testing domains.

As an example, let's say that I have a license configured for my domain, `mysite.com`, and I've configured two development domains, `devdomain.com` and `devdomain2.com`.

The license will cover the following domains:

- localhost
- *.mysite.com
- www.mysite.com
- mysite.com.local
- devdomain.com
- www.devdomain.com
- devdomain2.com
- www.devdomain2.com

Only 1 license can exist per Umbraco instance. 

## What does a license cover?

We use the same license model for Umbraco Forms and Umbraco Courier. There are a few differences as to what the licenses cover.

### Umbraco Forms license

- A single license covers a single installation of Umbraco Forms in production domains, as well as two additional development domains
- The production domain includes **all subdomains** (e.g. `*.mysite.com`), as well as the `.local` extension (e.g. `mysite.com.local`)
- The development domains works with or without the `www` subdomain
- The license allows for an unlimited number of forms
- The license also includes `localhost` as a valid domain
- The license is validated 

In the case the you run multiple sites within one Umbraco installation, e.g. you have multiple domains pointing at the same installation, you have the option to purchase and add **additional domains** to your license.

Additional domains can be purchased from your account on [Umbraco.com](https://umbraco.com) for 94 EUR. Each additional domain includes 1 live domain and 2 development / testing domains.

**Note** that this is an add-on domain for existing licenses. Refunds will not be given for this product.

### Umbraco Courier license

- A single license covers 1 production domain and 2 development domains
- The production domain includes all subdomains (e.g. `*.domain.tld`), as well as `.local` extension (e.g. `domain.tld.local`)
- The development domains works with or without the `www` subdomain
- The license also will include `localhost` as a valid domain

For Umbraco Courier you do not need to purchase additional domains if you are running multiple sites within the same Umbraco installation.



In the case that you run multiple sites within one Umbraco installation, it's possible to extend your license with additional domains if you wish to extend a license with additional domains, that option is also possible.
