# The Global Content

This Node lets you use your pre set up widgets. The way this works is that you navigate to the tree on the left, here you select Global Content.
In there you can choose to create a folder or a widget. When you have created a widget here it will work as a template in the future, so that you will only have to set it up once.

from here you select the node called Globale Widgets, you press the ... after doing that you will be prompted to choose from one of two options.

The first option is Globale Content, the second option is the Global Content Holder.
Let's dive a little deeper into these two options.

If you select the first option you will be presented with a screen looking like this:

When you press "Add Content"  a window will pop up where you can select what widget you want to work with (you can select multiple widgets):

Once you have selected the widget(s) you want to use, you set them up like you would do normally, the only difference here is that they will be marked as Global Content, and doing so makes it so that you can use these pre-setup widgets on multiple pages of your site where they will have the settings that you set up here.

Now for your second option in the Section tree, This is the Global Content Holder, Which gives you the option to create a folder for storing your global content within. You can even choose to make another folder within your folder.

Here you can see how you work with the  [Global Content Widget](../../Widgets/index.md#newsletterTheGlobalContentWidget)
