# The Global Content
		

This Node lets you create the widgets, that you will then later be able to, use in The Global Content Widget.
When you have created a widget here it will work as a template in the future, so that you will only have to set it up once, saving you a lot of time in the future. 
		

Setting your widgets up with this feature ensures that every time you make a new page, you can get the same design on each page.
This is because you made this template, all you will need to do is add it in the Global Content Widget, making it super straight forward to keep the same design on all of your pages.
		

## Setting up Globale Widgets

- Once you have selected the widget(s) you want to use
- You set them up like you would do normally, the only difference here is that they will be marked as Global Content
- Doing so makes it so that you can use these pre-setup widgets, on multiple pages of your site where they will have the settings that you set up here.
		

		

### Global Content Holder
		

Now for your second option in the Section tree
this is the Global Content Holder, Which gives you the option to create a folder, this is for storing your global content.
		

You can even choose to make another folder within your folder.
		

Here you can see how you work with the [Global Content Widget](../../Widgets/index.md#newsletterTheGlobalContentWidget)
