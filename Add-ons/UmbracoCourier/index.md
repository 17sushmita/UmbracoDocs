# Courier Documentation

Umbraco Courier is a tool that lets you deploy your schema and content from one Umbraco site to another. 

With Courier installed on your site, you can simply tell it to deploy an item from one site to another. Courier will then figure out what is needed for that specific item, package everything up, send it and finally extract it on the target site.

In this section you can find all the information you need in order to install, configure and work with Courier on a daily basis.
