# Umbraco Documentation project

# Reading & using the docs
This is the documentation project for Umbraco. The scope of this project is to provide overviews of concepts, tutorials, example code, and links to API reference.
We welcome valuable contributions from anyone willing to help. No matter if it is correcting spelling mistakes, raising an issue or writing a tutorial, everything counts and helps make Umbraco easier to use for everyone.

For details on how to contribute, see further down this page.

# Contributing to the documentation
Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how you can get involved and help with the Umbraco Documentation.

# Markdown conventions
The Umbraco Documentation uses Markdown for all of the documentation, please read about our [Markdown Conventions](Contribute/Markdown-Conventions/).

# Annotating a document

To add version information and extra keywords, [every document can be annotated using YAML](Contribute/adding-metadata.md). 

# Multi version documentation
Every new version of Umbraco introduces new features. This means that every document might not work for your possibly older version.

Therefore we introduced 2 different mechanisms:
1. The [YAML metadata describing](Contribute/adding-metadata.md) `versionFrom` and `versionTo`.
2. The possibility [to add multiple files about the same topic](Contribute/file-naming-conventions.md).
